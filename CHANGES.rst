0.7.1 (2012-12-27)
------------------

- Typo is fixed: ``LayerRecord.cilpping`` should be ``LayerRecord.clipping``.
  Thanks Oliver Zheng.

0.7 (2012-11-08)
----------------

- Highly experimental: basic layer merging is implemented
  (e.g. it is now possible to export layer group to a PIL image);
- ``Layer.visible`` no longer takes group visibility in account;
- ``Layer.visible_global`` is the old ``Layer.visible``;
- ``psd_tools.user_api.combined_bbox`` made public;
- ``Layer.width`` and ``Layer.height`` are removed (use ``layer.bbox.width``
  and ``layer.bbox.height`` instead);
- ``pil_support.composite_image_to_PIL`` is renamed to ``pil_support.extract_composite_image`` and
  ``pil_support.layer_to_PIL`` is renamed to ``pil_support.extract_layer_image``
  in order to have the same API for ``pil_support`` and ``pymaging_support``.

0.6 (2012-11-06)
----------------

- ``psd.composite_image()`` is renamed to ``psd.as_PIL()``;
- Pymaging support: ``psd.as_pymaging()`` and ``layer.as_pymaging()`` methods.


0.5 (2012-11-05)
----------------

- Support for zip and zip-with-prediction compression methods is added;
- support for 16/32bit layers is added;
- optional Cython extension for faster zip-with-prediction decompression;
- other speed improvements.

0.2 (2012-11-04)
----------------

- Initial support for 16bit and 32bit PSD files: ``psd-tools`` v0.2 can
  read composite (merged) images for such files and extract information
  (names, dimensions, hierarchy, etc.) about layers and groups of 16/32bit PSD;
  extracting image data for distinct layers in 16/32bit PSD files is not
  suported yet;
- better ``Layer.__repr__``;
- ``bbox`` property for ``Group``.

0.1.4 (2012-11-01)
------------------

Packaging is fixed in this release.

0.1.3 (2012-11-01)
------------------

- Better support for 32bit images (still incomplete);
- reader is able to handle "global" tagged layer info blocks that
  was previously discarded.

0.1.2 (2012-10-30)
------------------

- warn about 32bit images;
- transparency support for composite images.

0.1.1 (2012-10-29)
------------------

Initial release (v0.1 had packaging issues).
